[ ] How do we implement data for types?
  - Some types, like arrays, take extra information, (length, sub-type, etc.), how do we handle this?
  - Types are just rules. How do we approach that?

- A statement is either just evaluation, or both evaluation and an assignement.
  - Thus, we can break things up into evaluations, and assignements.

Simplest evaluation is pushing something from memory/imm to "stack".
Simplest assignement is popping something from "stack" to memory.

mov stack[top], mem[addr]
# vs
mov mem[addr], stack[top]
