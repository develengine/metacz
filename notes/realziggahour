- Alignment on types can influence whether a pointer of some type can be coerced to a pointer of a different type.
  - This way even a void* can have an alignment and be used to decide whether it can be coerced to a specific thing.
    - This would of course be only a single scope level thing that is only meant to help catch ze bugz.
  - The proper check would mostly just check whether a type of certain pointer can be coerced into a different type.
- Specifying alignment on variables and functions. (for their pointers)

| These things should be provided by the beckend and defined by a standard.

- Sentinel termination should be implemented on top of the metacz, not as part of it.

- Instead of having a "le-packed" keyword for structs, we should be able to provide the standard that it should use.

- named blocks are a must, (of course)
