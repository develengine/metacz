[X] Static arrays.
  [X] References.
  [X] Special references with length.

[ ] Function calling.
  [X] Store meta data for a function on the compiler and create a vm_func_ref_t type.
  [X] Calculate the function alignment during compilation.
    - But for recursive functions we would need to use the maximum alignment anyways, so maybe don't care?
    - We don't care, we will use the maximum alignment for everything.
  [ ] Add function calling methods to the metacz interface.
    [ ] Finish the metacz macros and have them return values as well and check errors too.
  [ ] Make the compiler recurse on function calls.
  [ ] We should also detect when we overstep the scope boundary with the function calls or other instructions.

[ ] Dynamic arrays.
[ ] Structures.
[ ] Global memory.
[ ] I/O instructions.
[ ] Type checking mechanisms.
